Assignment 1 Repository (FED) - Joseph

For my Assignment 1, I'm planning to create a website for a virtual reality game development company. For this website, I will be including the relevant content that is needed like the latest virtual reality game our company offers, list of virtual reality games we can offer to our customers, what our company is about, the team our company has and of course a Contact Us section and other information that is needed about the games my company is working on. 

Design Process
-----------------------------

User Audience Intent & Purpose

- The user audience's intent is to explore virtual reality gaming experiences through our website.
- Find out more about Enigma Innovations' products
- Be able to access information about the company, its team and contact information.

Who the website caters for

- The website is mainly targeted towards audiences who are interested or passionate in virtual reality gaming and wish to buy the VR video games that our company offers.

What the company caters for

- The company itself showcases its products, providing information about the team, and offering a section where users can contact us in case of any inquiries.

Wireframes are included in the project as well, do look forward to it! 

Features
-----------------------------
- Ease of Navigation
The website is designed in a way that is intuitive for users to navigate to different sections of the website and content displayed to users won't be too cluttered such that it'll paralyze the user. Hence, ease of navigation and comprehension.

- Glowing Navigation Links - Upon hovering your mouse cursor over the navigation links, the links will change colour upon contact. 

- Interactive Images  
Upon hovering your mouse cursor over images, whether it be on the home page or any other page, the image will slightly increase in size momentarily until you mouse off the image

- Buttons that have redirection capabilities
There are buttons specifically "Buy Now" buttons that will redirect you to a Steam webpage that relates to its game.

- Contact Us Input Boxes 
Allow users to type in particulars in case they wish they have further inquiries on the company or what it offers whatsover.

Technologies Used

- HTML (HyperText Markup Language)
