Design Process
-----------------------------

<h3><strong>User Audience Intent & Purpose</strong></h3>

- The user audience's intent is to explore virtual reality gaming experiences through our website.
- Find out more about Enigma Innovations' products
- Be able to access information about the company, its team and contact information.

Who the website caters for

- The website is mainly targeted towards audiences who are interested or passionate in virtual reality gaming and wish to buy the VR video games that our company offers.

What the company caters for

- The company itself showcases its products, providing information about the team, and offering a section where users can contact us in case of any inquiries.

<h3><strong>User Story</strong></h3>

- As a user I would want to find out more on the latest virtual reality games offered by the company so I know what are the various types of amazing VR games I could play.

- As a mobile user, I want the website to be responsive and easy to navigate on my device so that I can access parts of the website even when I'm on the go.

- As a customer when inquiries in mind, I would like to be able to easily find the Contact Us section so that I can reach out to the company for support or any further inquiries.

<h3><strong>Wireframes</strong></h3>

Wireframes are included in the project as well, do look forward to it! 

Features
-----------------------------

- Ease of Navigation  
The website is designed in a way that is intuitive for users to navigate to different sections of the website and content displayed to users won't be too cluttered such that it'll paralyze the user. Hence, ease of navigation and easier comprehension.

- Glowing Navigation Links  
Upon hovering your mouse cursor over the navigation links, the links will change colour upon contact. 

- Interactive Images  
Upon hovering your mouse cursor over images, whether it be on the home page or any other page, the image will slightly increase in size momentarily until you mouse off the image

- Buttons that have redirection capabilities  
There are buttons specifically "Buy Now" buttons that will redirect you to a Steam webpage that relates to its game.

- Contact Us Form
Allow users to type in particulars in case they wish they have further inquiries on the company or what it offers whatsover. 

- Contact Us Form Validation  
In the case of invalid inputs, the user will receive alerts from the website, telling the user that they should fill in the fields or fill in a proper email address.


Technologies Used
-----------------------------
- HTML (HyperText Markup Language) - Used for the main structure of the website e.g (what the header is like, where to place it)
- CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) - Used for the definition of how the website is going to be styled e.g (color of a few elements, arrangements and alignments etc.)
- JavaScript - Used for Website Interactability & Effects, particularly DOMContentLoaded where it reads the html document and looks for any element that is related to"nav a" to sort of create an animation/effect for navigation links.

Testing
-----------------------------
Do test the form validation on the "Contact Us" page/section of the website.

1. Go to the "Contact Us" Section/Page
2. Try to submit the form with no inputs and verify that an alert about filling in the fields appears.
3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that an alert should show up for that specific input.
4. Try to submit the form with all inputs being valid and verify that the form is successfully submitted.

There is an issue with the email validation where if even if you put name@gmai... without completing the email, it'll still be considered as a valid input as you fill in all the fields.
