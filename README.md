For my Assignment 1, I'm planning to design a website for a virtual reality game development company. For this website, I will be including things like concept art, game trailers, and other relevant information that is needed about the games my company is working on. 

Here are a few pointers:

- Making a good website would require a user-friendly navigation menu that allows visitors to easily look for information about the virtual reality games that our company has in store for them. 

- There will be a header which would contain a menu of hyperlinks in the homepage that will link to sections such as "Games", "About Us", "Team", and "Contact" which would make these sections easily accessible.

- The content will be laid out on how I want it to be, the arrangements, positioning of images, text, videos etc.
